#### What Your Academy Will Look Like

> When published, your Academy will feature two main sections ([This Page looks like](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/)
)

> - **[Learning Paths](/academy/learning-paths/)** - Structured courses combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on labs  
> 
> - **[Challenges](/academy/challenges/)** - Time-based, practical labs to test and validate skills


#### Build Process

> Here's the simple workflow:
>> 1. **Develop locally** - Make your changes and test them here  

>> 2. **Merge when ready** - Your Academy stays private until you decide to publish  

>> 3. **Publish when ready** - Release it to your organization
